=== RPNI ====
Regular Positive and Negative Inference
=== syntax ===
dfa = RPNI(positive, negative)
=== Description ===
RPNI starts from creating PTA according to positive samples. Initialize<br>
RED state set and BLUE state set as following:
 * set start state as RED state and add it to RED set.
 * add all the successors of start state to BLUE set.
After initialization, RPNI starts to extract each BLUE state and merge it for <br>
each RED state. After each Merge, we examine the new merged DFA if it<br>
accepts any negative sample,
 * if it does, abandon such DFA and promote currently manipulated BLUE
 state and continue another Merge.
 * if it does not accpet any negative sample, update DFA and add all the red
 states' successors which are not BLUE states to BLUE set. Until there's no
 BLUE state for Merge.
