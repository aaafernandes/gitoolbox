<font color='FF5B00'><h2> RPNI </h2></font>
Regular Positive and Negative Inference
<font color='B80028'><h2> syntax </h2></font>
dfa = RPNI(positive, negative)
<font color='B80028'><h2> Description </h2></font>
RPNI starts from creating PTA according to positive samples. Initialize RED state set and BLUE state set as following:
 * set start state as RED state and add it to RED set.
 * add all the successors of start state to BLUE set.
After initialization, RPNI starts to extract each BLUE state and merge it for each RED state. After each Merge, we examine the new merged DFA if it accepts any negative sample,
 * if it does, abandon such DFA and promote currently manipulated BLUE state and continue another Merge.
 * if it does not accpet any negative sample, update DFA and add all the red states' successors which are not BLUE states to BLUE set. Until
there's no BLUE state for Merge.
