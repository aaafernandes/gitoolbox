=== RPNI ====
Regular Positive and Negative Inference
=== syntax ===
dfa = RPNI(positive, negative)
=== Description ===
RPNI starts from creating PTA according to positive samples. Initialize
RED state set and BLUE state set as following:
 1. set start state as RED state and add it to RED set.
 2. add all the successors of start state to BLUE set.
After initialization, RPNI starts to extract each BLUE state and merge it 
for each RED state. After each Merge, we examine the new merged DFA if it
accepts any negative sample, 
 1. if it does, abandon such DFA and promote currently manipulated BLUE 
state and continue another Merge.
 2. if it does not accpet any negative sample, update DFA and add all the red 
states' successors which are not BLUE states to BLUE set. Until there's no BLUE
state for Merge.
