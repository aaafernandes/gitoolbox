<font color='B80028'><h2> Description </h2></font>
The DFFA is defined as a Class comprised of following properties:
 * *FiniteSetOfStates:* The set of finite states donated as Q
 * *Alphabets:* The set of alphabets
 * *InitialStateFrequency:* The frequency set of initial states there is exactly only one initial state whose initial state frequency is not zero.
 * *FinalStateFrequency:* The frequency set of final states.
 * *FrequencyTransitionMatrix:* The transition matrix of frequency indicating how many strings transmitting from one state to another.
 * *AssociateTransitionMatrix:* The associate transition matrix, the general state transition matrix.
 * *RED:* Set of all the red states
 * *BLUE:* Set of all the blue states
