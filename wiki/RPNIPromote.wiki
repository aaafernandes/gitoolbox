RPNI Promote
<font color='B80028'><h2> Syntax </h2></font>
[dfa, RED, BLUE] = RPNI_PROMOTE(blue, dfa)
<font color='B80028'><h2> Description </h2></font>
Basically RPNI_PROMOTE will promote a BLUE state to RED and add additional BLUE states <br>
to the set BLUE if necessary and return a _dfa_ with update sets of RED and BLUE states. As <br> 
optional output parameter it will also return the set of RED and the BLUE states. <br>
<br>
RPNI_PROMOTE(blue, dfa) needs two parameters:  <br>
 * _'blue'_ is the to be promoted blue state;  <br>
 * _'dfa'_ is the DFA of the blue state; <br>
The blue state will be added to the current set of red states, and then all the existing successors <br>
of this blue state will be transformed to be blue states which are then added to the set of blue states.
