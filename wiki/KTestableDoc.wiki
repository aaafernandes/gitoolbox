= Introduction =
A regular language can be parsed in certain bounded memory. But sometimes we have to learn a DFA <br>
from a subclass of language in which the memory is bounded as a priori. Given a size K of memory, we should <br>
try to find an automaton for the language. This subclass of language is called K-testable lanugage which has the <br>
property that the next character is only dependent on the previous _k-1_ characters. The machine designed to <br>
learn K-testable language is a K-testable machine. Our implementation has designed such a machine and managed <br>
to output a DFA from a set of K-testable language.

We've implemented following functions for KTestable:
 * [K2dfa  K2dfa]
 * [KSET KSET]
 * [KBuilder KBuilder]
