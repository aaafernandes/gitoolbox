= Introduction =
Alergia algorithm is another state-merging algorithm following the same <br>
idea with [RPNI RPNI] but from the probabilistic view. Corresponding with <br>
Deterministic Finite Automata, there's a term of Deterministic Probabilistic <br>
Finite Automata ([DPFA DPFA]) and Deterministic Frequency Finite Automata ([DFFA DFFA]). <br> 
In practice, we are dealing with frequency of samples most of time, but it is very <br> trivial to convert a DFFA to DPFA. Alergia is such a learning algorithm which is able <br>
to learn a DFFA and its corresponding DPFA from a sample containing duplicate strings. <br>
Check the function pages to view more details about the algorithm.
