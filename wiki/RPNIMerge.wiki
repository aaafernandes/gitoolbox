RPNI Merge
<font color='B80028'><h2> Syntax </h2></font>
dfa = RPNI_MERGE(dfa, q1, q2)
<font color='B80028'><h2> Description </h2></font>
This method will merge two states. <br>
*input:* the _dfa_, state _q1_ and _q2_ to be merged, _q1_ is a member of RED and _q2_ is a member of BLUE
*output:* the updated _dfa_ 
First of all, we find out the precedessor _(q_f)_ of BLUE state _(q2)_, according to the principle of RPNI, this <br>
precedessor is unique. And then set the transition _(q_f, a)_ as the RED state _(q1)_. After operations above, <br> 
a tree rooted at _q2_ will be isolated from _dfa_. Then we call [RPNIFold RPNI_FOLD] to concatenate this tree onto<br> 
current _dfa_.
*RPNI_MERGE* returns an updated dfa.
