= Introduction =
Evidence driven state merging is also called EDSM for abbreviation. It's another state merging algorithm <br>
similar with [RPNI RPNI]. The only difference compared with RPNI is that EDSM introduces a count function <br>
which is used to evaluate the merged dfa, but not like RPNI greedily select the first accepted dfa for the <br> 
next merge. That means EDSM requires more overhead on computing but provide more precise result.

= Function List =
We've implemented following functions for RPNI:
 * [EDSM EDSM]
 * [EDSMCount EDSM_Count]
 * [EDSMFold EDSM_FOLD]
 * [EDSMMerge EDSM_MERGE]
 * [EDSMPromote EDSM_PROMOTE]
