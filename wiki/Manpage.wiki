== About GI-Toolbox ==
We gave GI-Toolbox's birth since June in 2010. Our goal is simple. We are aiming to provide 
users a robust and effective toolbox for grammatical inference. We'll try our best to contribute
to this field as much as we can. We hope that our project can invoke more people's interest on 
grammatical inference and of cause any intention to join us is warmly welcome.

== Preliminary ==
In order to use the toolbox, you need at least a legal copy of Matlab, you can get more information 
from [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ here]. Since we presume that users who're about
to use our toolbox already have some basic knowledge of grammatical inference, so we're not going to 
spend time on giving any theoretical tutorial. 
=== Data Structure of DFA ===
{{{
     A DFA contains 6 sets:
     FiniteSetOfStates  
        FiniteSetOfStates is the set of finite states donated as Q
     Alphabets
        The set of alphabets
     TransitionMatrix
        The state transition matrix.
     InitialState
        The set of initial states
     FinalAcceptStates
        The set of final accepting states
     FinalRejectStates
        The rejecting states
}}} 

=== Data Structure of KSET ===
{{{
    A KSET contains 5 sets:
    Alphabets
        The set of alphabets
    ISET
        Prefixes of length k-1 and suffixes (or finals) of length k-1   
    CSET
        Short strings with length < k
    FSET
        Prefixes of length k-1 and suffixes (or finals) of length k-1
    TSET
        Allowed segments
}}}

=== Data Input Format ===
In order to make your program runnable, you should follow the format of input sample.
 * For RPNI and EDSM which require both positive and negative sample
{{{
    6 2
    1 1 a
    1 2 a a a
    1 3 b b a
    1 4 a b a b
    0 2 a b
    0 2 b b
}}}
