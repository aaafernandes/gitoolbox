== About GI-Toolbox ==
We gave GI-Toolbox's birth since June in 2010. Our goal is simple. We are aiming to provide 
users a robust and effective toolbox for grammatical inference. We'll try our best to contribute
to this field as much as we can. We hope that our project can invoke more people's interest on 
grammatical inference and of cause any intention to join us is warmly welcome.

== Preliminary ==
In order to use the toolbox, you need at least a legal copy of Matlab, you can get more information 
from [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ here]. Since we presume that users who're about
to use our toolbox already have some basic knowledge of grammatical inference, so we're not going to 
spend time on giving any theoretical tutorial. But you have to understand following issues so that you 
can make full use of the toolbox:
 * Data Structure of DFA

     We defined in matlab such a data structure for DFA:
