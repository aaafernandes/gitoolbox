== About GI-Toolbox ==
We gave GI-Toolbox's birth since June in 2010. Our goal is simple. We are aiming to provide 
users a robust and effective toolbox for grammatical inference. We'll try our best to contribute
to this field as much as we can. We hope that our project can invoke more people's interest on 
grammatical inference and of cause any intention to join us is warmly welcome.

== Preliminary ==
In order to use the toolbox, you need at least a legal copy of Matlab, you can get more information 
from [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ here].
