= Introduction =
The RPNI is a state-merging algorithm in grammatical inference. It uses two labels 
for the states in the automaton: Red states and Blue states. After a series of merges 
between the red states and blue states, promoting the states (e.g., blue to red ), the
target DFA is produced. For the details of RPNI please consult chapter 12 of [Documentation#Reference Colin's Book].

 * [RPNICompatible RPNI_COMPATIBLE]
 * [RPNIFold RPNI_FOLD]
 * [RPNIMerge RPNI_MERGE]
 * [RPNIPromote RPNI_PROMOTE]
