= Introduction =
The RPNI is a state-merging algorithm in grammatical inference. It uses two labels <br>
for the states in the automaton: Red states and Blue states. After a series of merges <br>
between the red states and blue states, promoting the states (e.g., blue to red ), the <br>
target DFA is produced. For the details of RPNI please consult chapter 12 of the book <br>
[Documentation#Reference Grammatical Inference: Learning Automata and Grammars.].
